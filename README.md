A straight-forward operating system for the Pale Raven Systems RMAD.

## **You ever just... wanted to feel a little more secure?** (*Now you can!*)

The PRS RMAD (Remote Access and Monitoring Device) allows for connecting to and configuring PRS Sonic Tripwires, makes cameras smarter, and can function as a passwordless entry device via USB or NFC.


## **Did I forget to mention that this isn't just a defense?**

The RMAD is also capable of... sorry let me re-read this... "takeover" - whatever that means. Go wild. [^1]

[^1]: It's capable of BadUSB, file transfer, etc. Really anything you could put on a usb stick will work here.
